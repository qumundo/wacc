# Weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) calculator of listed and unlisted companies based on an input-based API calculation engine. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) represents a company's blended average cost of capital across all financing sources, including common shares, preferred shares, and debt. The WACC is commonly used in a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis to find the net present value (NPV) of an investment and reflects the rate at which a companyâ€™s future free cash flows (FCFs) is discounted.

## How to use?

This module may be used to calculate, determine and retrieve weighted average cost of capital (WACC) parameters and metrics. You may self-define the required input parameter to calculate current, historical, future and/or scenario-based parameters and metrics based on your own data and assumptions. Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) parameters and metrics can be calculated in various ways; this module gives you the option to calculate, determine and retrieve weighted average cost of capital (WACC) parameters and metrics through various methods.

### :link: Import the module

Import the module in your code:

`const WACC = require("@qumundo/wacc")`

### :arrow_right: Create request schema and define input parameters

```javascript
let wacc_item =
{
  "id": "",
  "id_type": "",
  "legal_entity": "Company X",
  "fiscal_year": 2020,
  "date": "2020-12-31",

  "weight_debt": 0.007758,
  "cost_equity": 0.043090,
  "weight_equity": 0.992241
}
```

### :arrow_right: Get wacc parameters for created schema and defined input parameters

```javascript

let wacc_request = { data: [] };

wacc_request.data.push(wacc_item);  // Up to 5 items/calculation per request

let wacc = await WACC.getWACC(wacc_request);

/*
wacc.data[0] ===

{
  "success": true,
  "message": "",
  "id": "",
  "id_type": "",
  "legal_entity": "Company X",

},

*/
```

### :arrow_right: Get example request schema

```javascript
let wacc_request = await WACC.getExample(true, false);  // (request, response)
```

### :arrow_right: Get example response schema

```javascript
let wacc_response = await WACC.getExample(false, true);  // (request, response)
